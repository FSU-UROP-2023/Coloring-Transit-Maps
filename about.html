  <h1>ABOUT</h1>

  <div class="box">

    <p id="textBox">Transit maps have always been considered to be a useful tool in navigating transportation in the
      everyday life of a commuter. Despite its necessity for a commuter’s successful trip, many maps, including the FSU
      bus system, are difficult to read and especially inaccessible to those with vision disabilities. As a result, we
      aim to produce a program that can create a colorset of a variable number of colors that are very different from
      each other for both the average population as well as for colorblind individuals. To determine the optimal
      colorset, we used the perceptually linear color space, OKLab, to accurately maximize the minimum Euclidean
      distance between any two colors from the colorset based on a deuteranopia perspective. After accounting for
      popular color vision deficiencies, we further optimize our color set for normal vision. We expect to generate
      colorsets that are perceptually further apart than many transit maps like FSU’s. The findings of this research
      will provide valuable insights for subway map designers and developers, as well as contribute to the ongoing
      discourse on the role of color in information design.
